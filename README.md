Simple Home Control Dashboard to start and Shutdown Computers

## Usage

This Project was developed and used to start and shut down a local server.
For this purpose we developed a simple node backend (https://github.com/Zelle97/remote-server) to start and shutdown servers.

For a simpler usage we connected that backend with a frontend dashboard (https://github.com/Zelle97/remote-dashboard) that can be accessed with a browser.

Its quite small and simple but works as intended.

## Docker on Raspberry

We used the automated builds from DockerHub to create the images.
Because DockerHub doesen't support multiple architecture builds, if you want to use this project on a raspberry you have to build the images from source.
You will find the Instructions in the repos of the backend and dashboard.
